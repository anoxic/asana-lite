Goal

To make a minimal wrapper around Asana
that works well on degraded environments
such as feature phones, legacy and 
text-only browsers, and slow internet 
connections.


Architecture

Trying to keep it as simple as possible,
there are a couple of things going on:

1. We use as thin a wrapper as possible 
   around the Asana API
2. Models are separated from views, and
   rendering and formatting goes through
   Mustache templates.


Folder Structure

composer.json  Dependency definitions.
config/        Flat config files.
lib/           Application functions
               and classes.
public/        Public facing php and 
               assets, in lieue of 
               routing or microframeworks.
vendor/        Third-party libraries.
views/         Mustache templates.


TODO

o   pagination.
o   view single tasks and children.
o   update a task.
o   complete a task.
o   error checking.
o   postgres db for caching.
o   zmq to spin off fetches.
o   oauth.
o   css.
