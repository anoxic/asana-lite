Asana Lite
----------

A lightweight Asana subset.


Architecture

Trying to keep it as simple as possible, there are a couple of things going on:

1. We use as thin a wrapper as possible around the Asana API
2. Models are separated from views, and rendering and formatting goes through Mustache templates.


Folder Structure

composer.json  Dependency definitions
config/        Flat config files
lib/           Application functions and classes
public/        All public facing php files are kept here. This is instead of routes.
vendor/        Dependencies (third-party libraries)
views/         Where mustache templates are kept
